5. Searching objects in the database
6. Working with simple relationships via tables (one-to-many, many-to-one)

@Entity - annotation for class, mark class as the future table in DB
@Id  - annotation for the field, mark field as primary key in DB. You can use autogenerated ids on the DB side or on the java side. 
@ManyToOne,@OneToMany - annotation for the field, mark field as a reference to another table
@Table - annotation for class, you can change the name of the
